# Angular-Spring-Boot-CRUD-Full-Stack-backend
I have developed a simple book application allowing users to operate CRUD functionalities. 
I utilized an angular framework at the front-end and a Spring boot at the back-end. 
My frontend angular code is @ shivamapchan/Angular-Spring-Boot-CRUD-Fullstack-frontend.
